# 🧸 YouTube Kids Channel Slop Finder

A script for searching suspicious YouTube channels targeting kids, often with repetitive content, identical video formats, and questionable moral values.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project aims to surface a growing issue on YouTube — the presence of near-duplicate kids channels that recycle the same types of videos, often with:
* Copy-pasted content (same thumbnails, titles, and scripts)
* Ethically questionable messaging or behavior
* Hidden marketing, excessive screen time patterns, or manipulative narratives
* Lack of originality, often optimized purely for algorithmic reach

Many of these channels appear mass-produced, possibly automated, and create a misleading environment for children and parents alike.

## 🔍 What the Script Does

The script in first phase just search for existing channels with changes in the names which seems to be common practive in these channels.

It outputs a list of channels that match these patterns, helping researchers, watchdog groups, and parents understand what’s really being pushed to kids on the platform.
